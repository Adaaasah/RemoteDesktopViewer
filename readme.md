## What is it?
Remote Desktop Viewer is an open-source program which allows the user to maintain multiple RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections. The program uses the Windows integrated application `Remote Desktop Connection` to maintain a connection between two desktops.

The application is built with WPF and the .NET Framework 4.7.2 for Windows Applications.

Two built-in client softwares are used as the base of this program.

### Mstsc.exe
mstsc.exe is the built-in client software which allows connecting to a computer via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It is a special network protocol which allows a user to establish a connection between two computers and access the Desktop of a remote host. 

More info about it can be found [here](https://winaero.com/blog/mstsc-exe-command-line-arguments/#:~:text=Remote%20Desktop%20(mstsc.exe)%20Command%20Line%20Arguments,Desktop%20of%20a%20remote%20host.).

### Qusuer
Quser (query user) is a built-in Windows command line tool that is particularly useful when needing to identify active user sessions on a computer.  This feature exists in regular Windows versions as well as Windows Server.
